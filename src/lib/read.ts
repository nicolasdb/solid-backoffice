/**
 * Turtle reads for display, revalidated instead of downloaded again (L5).
 *
 * Each document read keeps its ETag and body in memory. The next read of the
 * same address asks the server with `If-None-Match`; a 304 hands back the kept
 * body. The server is asked every time, so nothing shown is ever older than
 * the pod: this saves the download, not the round trip, and a read on someone
 * else's pod still reaches their access log.
 *
 * Only for showing things. A write reads its base through `conditional.ts`,
 * which never keeps a copy (its invariant 1). Memory only, never browser
 * storage: pod data must not outlive the session. `forgetReads()` at sign-out.
